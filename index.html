FEATURED ESSAY
What a Camera Cannot See
ESSAY  ·  FEBRUARY 16, 2026  ·  1 MIN READ
Is a thousand words enough?
The world is freaking out about images that do not represent reality. But Plato warned us 2,400 years ago not to trust shadows on a cave wall. A photograph of a mountain does not contain what the eye truly saw. The northern lights never look right in print.
Finding the truth may require going beyond the image — to see light not rendered in pixels, brush strokes, or shadows.

RECENT WRITING

TRAVEL
Flight
What does it feel like to fly?
After millions of miles in airplanes, the experience of real flight still feels out of reach. Not the roar of takeoff or the float of landing — but the hawk's silence on an updraft, skimming above glassy water. For travelers, air miles are mostly about the wait.

BOOK
Chasing Lights: Cover Design Winner
Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog
Caspar David Friedrich's 19th-century painting arrived in Gunnar's life long after he left Alaska — yet he immediately recognized the figure on the mountain. He had stood in that man's place more than once, staring out over a massive and wild world.

REFLECTION
Nobody
Be somebody? Is that what we're supposed to do?
How often are we told to control our destiny, make a mark, be important? Standing with strangers, overwhelmed by anonymity, Gunnar finds unexpected freedom in accepting smallness — and questions whether the hoi polloi were ever meant to rise above.

REFLECTION
On Being Foreign
Do I belong here?
At six years old, Gunnar's family moved thousands of miles away — odd customs, different voices, landscapes with new rules of engagement. That's when he became a foreigner. After several cities and decades, he's still not sure he stopped feeling that way.

NATURE & PLACE
Life on the Moon
Moonlight from below
On the 5 AM Northeastern train out of Washington, DC, thick frost coats every Delaware backyard — a little exotic, a little Alaskan. The full moon punches a hole in the sky. The sun rises on the other side, turning rooftop snow pink. What a gift to see such sights.

NATURE & PLACE
Snow Storm
Is this wonderful?
A cancelled flight. A storm that shut down half the country. But Gunnar recalls a Chicago winter morning when he biked to work through perfect sunshine — only to look up at 5 PM to find snow falling silently outside. Nothing to do but embrace it.

Letting Go
To cut or not to cut?
It doesn't matter how many hours were spent in the writing, how much research, how much refining. Going through final edits of Chasing Lights, Gunnar realized an entire chapter had to go. It didn't fit. A few hours later, he said goodbye — and the book got better. Just like life. Pruning is a brutal act.

LONG FORM REFLECTION
How Star Trek Influenced my Writing
So much of how one sees the world is based on what we read and what we watch. Gunnar watched a lot of Star Trek as a kid — and asks how much of what he believes and what he writes is based on that?

LONG FORM REFLECTION
Is Alaska a Real Place?
Alaska seems like a place of myth — how could someone grow up there, have a normal-ish life, and experience all the things kids do? It's an interesting story.

LONG FORM REFLECTION
The Importance of Montage
It's not just a cheap trick — a montage is how we speak directly to memory.

LONG FORM REFLECTION
Is Binge-Watching a Bad Thing?
Or is it something we desperately need — the chance to be part of a slowly unfolding story? Perhaps binge-watching is how we reach out for something deeper.
